## P0: Core Parity Blockers

### P0-1: Agent Benchmarking & Performance Profiling System

**Labels:** `P0: parity-blocker`, `agent-management`, `gap-analysis`, `enhancement`, `backend`

#### Context

CipherSwarm has a full agent benchmarking system that hash_hive currently lacks. Benchmarks are central to intelligent task assignment — without knowing each agent's per-hash-type throughput, the scheduler can't optimally distribute work.

#### CipherSwarm Reference

- **HashcatBenchmark model** (6.4 KB): Stores per-agent, per-hash-type benchmark results
- **Agent state machine**: `pending → active → benchmarked → error/stopped` — agents aren't fully operational until benchmarked
- **API endpoint**: `POST /api/v1/client/agents/{id}/submit_benchmark`
- **Benchmark progress indicator**: CipherSwarm issue #613
- **Incremental benchmark submission**: CipherSwarm issue #612

#### What hash_hive Needs

1. **Benchmark data model** — Store per-agent, per-hash-type throughput (hashes/sec) with hardware context
2. **Agent state machine enhancement** — Add `benchmarked` state; agents should benchmark before accepting tasks
3. **Agent API endpoint** — Agents submit benchmark results after registration
4. **Benchmark-aware task assignment** — Feed benchmark data into the task scheduler for proportional keyspace chunks
5. **Dashboard display** — Show benchmark results per agent (table of hash types × throughput)

#### Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Agents can submit benchmark results via API
- [ ] Benchmark data is persisted per agent per hash type
- [ ] Agent state machine reflects benchmark status
- [ ] Task scheduler considers benchmark data when assigning work
- [ ] Dashboard shows agent benchmark results

### P0-2: Cracker Binary Management & Agent Auto-Update

**Labels:** `P0: parity-blocker`, `agent-management`, `gap-analysis`, `enhancement`, `backend`

#### Context

CipherSwarm tracks hashcat binary versions and provides an auto-update mechanism. This ensures all agents run compatible cracker versions and can be updated centrally rather than touching each rig manually.

#### CipherSwarm Reference

- **CrackerBinary model**: Tracks hashcat versions, binaries per OS/architecture
- **API endpoint**: `GET /api/v1/client/crackers/check_for_cracker_update`
- **CrackersController** (91 lines): Serves binary metadata and download info
- **OperatingSystem model**: OS/architecture combinations for binary matching
- **Admin interface**: Upload and manage cracker binary versions

#### What hash_hive Needs

1. **Cracker binary registry** — Model to track hashcat versions with platform-specific binaries
2. **Binary storage** — Store cracker binaries in MinIO
3. **Agent API endpoint** — Version check + presigned download URL
4. **Version tracking** — Record which hashcat version each agent runs
5. **Dashboard management** — UI for uploading new cracker releases

#### Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Server tracks cracker binary versions per platform
- [ ] Agents check for updates via API and download via presigned URLs
- [ ] Dashboard shows per-agent cracker version
- [ ] Admin can upload new cracker versions

#### Related hash_hive Issues

- #37 (Agent API Epic), #19 (Agent Management System)

### P0-3: Attack Templates — Reusable Attack Definitions

**Labels:** `P0: parity-blocker`, `campaign-management`, `gap-analysis`, `enhancement`

#### Context

CipherSwarm has reusable Attack Templates (attack type + parameters + resource references) that can be applied to different hash lists without reconfiguring from scratch. Essential for operational efficiency when running standardized strategies across campaigns.

#### CipherSwarm Reference

- **Template model**: Stores attack type, hashcat parameters, resource references
- **Template → Attack instantiation**: Templates pre-fill concrete Attacks within a Campaign
- **Web UI**: Create, edit, browse, and apply templates

#### What hash_hive Needs

1. **Template data model** — attack mode, resource references, hashcat parameters, name/description
2. **Template CRUD API** — Dashboard endpoints for template management
3. **Template instantiation** — Select a template when creating campaign attacks to pre-fill config
4. **Campaign wizard integration** — Offer template selection as a starting point
5. **Project scoping** — Templates follow multi-tenancy model

#### Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Templates can be created, listed, edited, deleted via API
- [ ] Template stores: name, description, attack mode, hashcat params, resource refs
- [ ] Campaign wizard supports template selection
- [ ] Templates are project-scoped

### P0-4: Keyspace-Based Task Distribution with Dynamic Chunking

**Labels:** `P0: parity-blocker`, `task-distribution`, `gap-analysis`, `enhancement`, `backend`

#### Context

**This is the single most critical gap.** CipherSwarm's TaskAssignmentService (18.9 KB) divides attack keyspace across agents proportional to their capabilities. hash_hive has BullMQ task queuing but no keyspace-aware distribution.

#### CipherSwarm Reference

- **TaskAssignmentService** (18.9 KB): Core scheduling with diagnostics and skip-reason tracking
- **Keyspace partitioning**: Chunk sizes proportional to agent benchmark throughput
- **Task claim fields**: `claimed_at`, `claimed_by_agent_id` for atomic claiming
- **CipherSwarm issue #622**: priority:critical, effort:large

#### What hash_hive Needs

1. **Keyspace calculation** — Total keyspace per attack based on mode, wordlist sizes, rule counts, mask length
2. **Dynamic chunk sizing** — Divide keyspace proportional to agent benchmarks (depends on P0-1 benchmark system)
3. **Atomic task claiming** — Prevent double-assignment (note GOTCHAS.md: no native `FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED` in Drizzle — use `db.execute(sql\`...\`)`)
4. **Progress tracking** — Track keyspace offset/limit/completed per task
5. **Dynamic rebalancing** — Redistribute remaining keyspace when fleet changes
6. **Diagnostic logging** — Log assignment decisions for debugging

#### Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Attacks divided into keyspace-based task chunks
- [ ] Chunk sizes account for agent benchmark data
- [ ] Atomic task claiming (no double-assignment)
- [ ] Progress tracked as keyspace units
- [ ] Remaining keyspace redistributable on fleet changes

#### Technical Notes

- GOTCHAS.md: no native `FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED` in Drizzle ORM — use `db.execute(sql\`...\`)`
- Circular import `campaigns.ts ↔ tasks.ts` — use `_deps` injection pattern

#### Related hash_hive Issues

- #23 (Task Distribution System)
- **Depends on:** P0-1 (Agent Benchmarking)

### P0-5: Task Preemption for Priority-Based Workload Balancing

**Labels:** `P0: parity-blocker`, `task-distribution`, `gap-analysis`, `enhancement`, `backend`

#### Context

Without preemption, a low-priority campaign running on all agents blocks newly created high-priority campaigns from getting any resources. CipherSwarm solves this with a dedicated preemption service.

#### CipherSwarm Reference

- **TaskPreemptionService** (7.1 KB): Priority-based workload balancing algorithm
- **CampaignPriorityRebalanceJob**: Event-driven trigger on priority changes
- **Preemption tracking fields** in database
- **Task transitions**: `running → paused` (preempted), `paused → running` (resumed)

#### What hash_hive Needs

1. **Preemption algorithm** — Identify lower-priority running tasks to pause for higher-priority work
2. **Preemption-aware task states** — `paused` state with reason tracking (preempted vs user-initiated)
3. **Event-driven trigger** — Evaluate preemption on priority changes and new campaign starts
4. **Agent notification** — Tell preempted agents to stop and pick up new work
5. **Resume logic** — Preempted tasks become eligible when high-priority work completes
6. **Audit trail** — Track what was preempted, when, why

#### Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Higher-priority campaigns preempt lower-priority running tasks
- [ ] Preempted tasks are paused (not cancelled) and can resume
- [ ] Preemption triggered by priority changes and new campaign starts
- [ ] Agents notified to stop preempted work
- [ ] Preemption events logged

#### Related hash_hive Issues

- #23 (Task Distribution System)
- Closely related to P0-4 (Keyspace Distribution)

### P0-6: Hash Item Storage, Crack Result Tracking & Zap System

**Labels:** `P0: parity-blocker`, `hash-management`, `gap-analysis`, `enhancement`, `backend`

#### Context

This is the core data flow that makes a distributed cracking platform useful: agents submit cracks, the server records them, and other agents are told not to waste time on already-cracked hashes ("zaps").

#### CipherSwarm Reference

- **HashItem model**: Individual hashes with cracked/uncracked status and plaintext
- **HashcatGuess model**: Cracked password records
- **CrackSubmissionService** (6.2 KB), **StatusSubmissionService** (6.2 KB)
- **HashcatStatus model** (12.4 KB): Rich status data from running attacks

- **CipherSwarm issue #623**: Live zap system for cross-hashlist dedup

#### What hash_hive Needs

1. **Hash item model** — Individual records: hash value, salt, cracked status, plaintext, cracked_at, cracked_by_agent
2. **Crack submission endpoint** — Agent API for hash:plaintext pairs
3. **Status submission endpoint** — Agent API for speed, progress, temperature, ETA
4. **Zap endpoint** — Agent fetches hashes cracked since last check (skip solved hashes)
5. **Result aggregation** — Dashboard views for results per campaign/hash list
6. **Progress calculation** — Derive progress from cracked/total counts

#### Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Individual hashes stored and tracked within hash lists
- [ ] Agents submit crack results and status updates via API
- [ ] Agents fetch "zaps" — hashes cracked by others
- [ ] Dashboard shows crack results and progress
- [ ] Campaign progress derived from hash item status
